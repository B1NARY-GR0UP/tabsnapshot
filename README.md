TABSNAPSHOT is a Chrome extension that allows you to create a snapshot for the current open tabs.

## Install

Since TABSNAPSHOT has not been released on the Chrome Web Store yet (it will be released later), you can install it using the following steps:

1. Download the source code zip file from the [releases](https://github.com/B1NARY-GR0UP/tabsnapshot/releases).
2. Extract the zip file to a location you prefer (usually where you store other software).
3. Open Chrome's `Extensions` page.
4. Turn on the `Developer mode` toggle in the upper right corner.
5. Click the `Load unpacked` button and select the source code folder you just extracted.
6. You will see that TABSNAPSHOT has been successfully installed in your Chrome.
7. Turn off developer mode.

## Usage

The current features supported by TABSNAPSHOT include:

- Save all currently open tabs in Chrome as a snapshot item.
- Open, Rename, Update and Delete saved snapshots.
- Preview saved snapshots.
- Open or Delete All saved snapshots at once.

**Note: All TABSNAPSHOT features are integrated into the plugin's pop-up panel. Make sure to have TABSNAPSHOT properly installed and pinned to your Chrome for these functionalities.**
